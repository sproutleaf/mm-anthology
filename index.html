                <p>When I first met Mack, I was obsessed with watching former NASA astronauts' space education videos on
                    YouTube.
                    I asked him if he likes Chris Hadfield upon learning that he's Canadian and training to be a pilot,
                    and he said,
                    "Yeah! I have his book right next to me."</p>

                <img src="media/aeropress.jpg">
                <p>I sold my espresso machine shortly before falling in love with Mack. Obviously, had we started dating
                    earlier, I'd have kept the espresso machine so he could make me
                    cappucino whenever he's around.</p>

                <p>I asked Mack if he could pinpoint the moment he fell in love with me, and he said it was after we had
                    an extended conversation on Cross Laminated Timber.</p>

                <p>When we were still friends, Mack texted me out of the blue and said we should get matching CW&T key
                    wranglers. Now we do.</p>

                <img src="media/murai-stool.jpg">
                <p>Long before we met, Mack and I were already separetely huge fans of M+, and we wouldn't stop raving
                    about the
                    stools on display. Can you believe that? Within the biggest contemporary art collection in
                    Asia, what tucked both of our heartstrings were just a bunch of stools. We're going to buy 20 stools
                    when we move in together.</p>

                <p>We also separately bought the same Akari 1A dupe from Taobao. Sometimes, I'd like to believe that
                    we're the same person.</p>

                <p>If we can't shut up about the public transportation in Hong Kong and the Octopus card it's because
                    they are excellent.</p>

                <p>I offhandedly commented that these keychains were cute at Ace Hotel Toronto, and Mack immediately
                    bought 2 for us.</p>

                <p>Ever since Mack mentioned that his dream bike would comprise of a frame crafted by an independent
                    maker in Brooklyn, fantasizing about us going on long bike trips has become my salve in
                    the coldest, most isolated days. Breezy summer weather, us on the wheels, flowing through the
                    streets of Brooklyn, admiring Hudson River, crossing over to Jersey...</p>
